# yaflandia
This repository hosts a Vim colorscheme taylored for C and especially C++ development. Colorscheme relies 
on [additional Vim syntax groups](https://github.com/JBakamovic/yavide/blob/master/core/syntax/after/syntax/cpp/cpp_syntax_highlight.vim) so for the best experience one should have those available as well.

My other project [`Yavide`](https://github.com/JBakamovic/yavide) auto-generates those syntax
groups so this colorscheme rather plays best within that environment.

Influenced by [`flatlandia`](https://github.com/jordwalke/flatlandia) and [`flatland`](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) colorschemes.
