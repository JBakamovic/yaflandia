# yaflandia
This repository hosts a Vim colorscheme taylored for C and especially C++ development. Colorscheme relies 
on additional Vim syntax groups so for the best experience one should have those available as well.

My other project `Yavide` (https://github.com/JBakamovic/yavide) auto-generates those syntax
groups so this colorscheme rather plays best within that environment. Although very close to the end, auto-generation of syntax groups feature is still in development. To try it out one would need to checkout the `syntax_generator` branch in `Yavide`.

Heavily influenced by `flatlandia` (https://github.com/jordwalke/flatlandia) and `flatland` 
(https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) colorschemes.
